	        "inlineTranscriptBody": "We’ve created a graphic to show the flow of engagement economic data, starting with responsible pricing and ending with how credit holds and write-offs appear on the Firm’s financial statements.<br><br>Let’s take a look at each of the four phases.<br><br>The first phase is Negotiations. Economic stewardship starts with responsible pricing. Pricing should be at or above team bundle rates, which will allow a margin, or room in the WIP for small contingencies.<br><br>Some studies include a Client Investment or Fees at Risk arrangement. For Fees at Risk arrangements, a percentage is billed when the Firm meets the pre-determined criteria.<br><br>The Firm’s philosophy is to price for value and team costs. We don’t price our engagements by time and materials. This means that the client is guaranteed the scope of the impact for the fee agreed to. If we underestimate the price, the Firm must cover the additional cost.<br><br>The Confirmation phase is when the client agrees to our price and terms and you complete a Client Engagement Report—or CER—and confirm the staffing and charge plans. The completed CER is your engagement’s itemized budget. Complete it by entering the financial details for the engagement, among other information. The financial details include total fees and the forecasted New Service Capabilities, time charges, and expenses required to deliver on the engagement scope. They also include details about Client Investment or Fees at Risk when applicable. The CER is automatically populated with the client code once it’s assigned.<br><br>During the Engagement phase, team members, leaders, experts, and support staff charge time and expenses to the client code. Each month, a WIP report—or Work-in-Progress report—is generated for that client code, including ALL received charges to the client code. WIP reports also include the itemized budget from the CER and show the variance, or difference, between the actuals to date and the forecasted budget for the life of the engagement. Invoice and collection data are also included on the WIP. Efficient management of invoices and collections optimizes the Firm’s working capital.<br><br>One indicator of the state of the economics of an engagement is the WIP balance. A negative balance is favorable because it means that the total billed is greater than the total fees and expenses incurred. A positive balance is unfavorable because it means that the total fees and expenses incurred are greater than the total billed.<br><br>The End-of-engagement phase starts when the team rolls off and the last invoice is sent. Be mindful that there's normally a lag in some expenses showing on the WIP, and time can still be charged. If, at the End-of-engagement phase, you have a positive WIP balance, it means that you went over budget, and you have an overrun. If you have a negative WIP balance, the engagement stayed under budget, and you have a credit hold, or value bill.<br><br>The client code is closed when the final WIP position is around USD2,500, all unpaid invoices are cleared, and it is at least three months after the end of the engagement.<br><br>The economics of each engagement are part of the office, region, and Firm financial statements.<br><br>On Office and Firm P&L reports, revenue is generated when time and expenses are charged to a client code with revenue flowing to the office that individual belongs to.<br><br>Net Value Adjustments are corrections to revenue and comprised of write-offs and write-ups—or permanent adjustments—and reserves—or temporary provisions—applied to WIP / AR balances due to age. On the office and Firm balance sheet WIP, AR and reserve balances are reflected in current assets.<br><br>Engagement economics is easier to follow when you know how the data flows.",

The monthly columns show actual fees and expenses incurred each month for the past three months. The CER column shows the itemized budget for the life of the engagement as entered in the CER system.<br><br>The Variance column is the difference between the Total Incurred up to the end of the WIP reporting month and the CER column.<br><br>Now, let's turn to the second page, the Time Summary page, which shows all internal time charges. The CSS time shows team member names, their positions, which offices they're from, and their engagement nominal per diems. The Actuals to Date columns show total days and the effective per diems charged prior and by month; the Effective per diem differs from the engagement nominal per diem if there is an investment or portion of the work that is contingent or satisfaction-based.<br><br>The CER columns reflect what has been entered into the CER budget, including days, effective per diems, and resultant total fees. Actuals Higher/Lower than CER compares time charged to the engagement against what is budgeted. Investment shows the amount the total incurred fees are reduced after applying the Client Investment percentage when applicable.<br><br>The third page is the Expense Summary, which details the expense charges. Here, you have the visibility into the expenses charged by each person broken down by category. That’s it for our quick tour of the WIP.",
